A class is used to group all the data members and member functions 
that hiding the internal details


Example:-

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
 
class Example {
private:
    // private variables
    int a, b, c;
public:
    void sum(int x, int y)
    {
        a = x;
        b = y;
        cout<<"Sum of the two number is : "<<a+b<<endl;
    }
};
int main()
{
    Example e;
    e.sum(5, 4);
    return 0;
}
